# Vaccination-App

The Vaccination App is a Java program that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing and displaying vaccine information. It allows users to add details about vaccines and view the information based on various criteria.

How to Use
Open the Java file named MainMenu.java in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.

The MainMenu class extends the JFrame class, creating a GUI window for the application.

The GUI window displays a welcome message and the names of the group members who worked on the assignment.

The menu bar at the top of the window provides two main options: "Add Details" and "View Details."

Add Details

Select the "Add Details" option from the menu bar to add information about a vaccine.
This action opens a new window for adding details.
The window size is set to 500x600 pixels.
The user can input the required vaccine details in the new window.
View Details

Select the "View Details" option from the menu bar to view the vaccine information.
This action provides several sub-options for viewing information based on different criteria: date, city, vaccine name, and total number of vaccines.
Select the desired sub-option to open a new window for displaying the corresponding information.
The window size is set to 500x600 pixels.
The information is displayed in the new window according to the selected criteria.
The program terminates after performing the selected action.
